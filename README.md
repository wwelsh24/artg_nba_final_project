# 2022-2023 NBA Regular Season Team Ratings Visualiztions

by William Welsh

**Abstract**

This project creates a tool to visualize NBA lineup performance, quantified by Offensive Rating, Defensive Rating, and Net Rating. 
Currently, data is captured for the 2022-2023 regular season, although more statistics and years of data may be added in the future.
The home page is limited to lineups with 48 minutes played together, although each team has a page with every lineup utilized this season. 
The project also includes a narrative explanation of how ratings are calculated.
